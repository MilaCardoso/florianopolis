    <h1>Why Florianópolis?</h1>
    <div class="main-content">  
        <p>Pretty much every landscape and experience here is magical, in all honesty. Visitors will witness lush rainforest trails that run along local farms that sell fresh fruit and produce. Follow a path and discover hidden coves with white-sand beaches and seaside huts selling caldo de cana (sugarcane juice).</p>
        <p>Hiking is also big here; and one of my favorite trails is the Naufragados hiking trail. It leads to a private beach with the occasional peacock frolicking about.</p>
        <p>The center of the island has a more hippie vibe. It’s a trendy area with rustic restaurants and artsy cafes; perfect for backpackers and intrepid travelers. Step foot near Lagoa da Conceição and find the center of it all – a great place for nightlife, surfer shops and live music. When I lived in Floripa, I choose an apartment in this area because it is central – easy to get to from both the north and south side of the island.</p>
        <p>But there is much more to this island than its diverse activities; there are also myths that go way back. Florianopolis is also called “Ilha da Magia” (the Magic Island) because its charm and beauty conquers whomever steps foot on its soil. Fables from years ago tell tales of witches and sorcerers casting spells and curses on locals. Legend says that the boulders off the beach of Praia de Itaguaçu were once witches before they were turned to stone.</p>
