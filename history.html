    <h1>History of Florianopolis</h1>
    <div class="main-content">
        <p>
            Carijós Indians, a Tupi people, were the first inhabitants of Florianópolis area. The traces of its presence are verified 
            through archaeological sites and sambaquis dating up to 4000 years ago. The Indians called the place Meiembipe or "mountain 
            along the channel".
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 1514 the Portuguese landed and gave the area the name Ilha dos Patos, but in 1526 it was renamed Ilha de Santa Catarina 
            (Saint Catherine Island). The area supplied the vessels that went to the River Plate (Río de la Plata) Basin.
            The official settlement of the island began in 1673 with the arrival of bandeirante Francisco Dias Velho's agricultural 
            company and it continued in 1678 with the construction of a chapel consecrated to Nossa Senhora do Desterro. At this time a 
            villa began to take form, slowly becoming a colonial settlement.
        </p>
        <p>
            To guarantee its domain the Portuguese Crown elevated Santa Catarina Island to the category of village in 1714 with the name of 
            Nossa Senhora do Desterro and already in 1726 they promoted it again, now to the category of town.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this date on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port began to have a strategic function because it was situated halfway 
            between Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, possibly two of the largest seaside cities of South America at that time. For this 
            reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive 
            seaside defensive ring of Southern Brazil started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa 
            Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul fortresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the coming of the Captaincy the population began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 
            with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of Azores and from Madeira Island. The development of the 
            agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation. In 1823, during the monarchy which 
            ended in 1889, Desterro became the Capital of Santa Catarina Province opening a period of prosperity with many urban works and 
            also intense political organization.
        </p>
            Regional elites not happy with the government centralization staged the Revolta Federalista (Federalist Revolt) at the 
            beginning of the Brazilian Republic. The movement that started in Rio Grande do Sul spread to Santa Catarina and turned 
            Desterro into the Federalist Capital of the Republic. The then president of Brazil, Marechal Floriano Peixoto, known as Iron 
            Marshal, suppressed the rebellion and ordered the shooting of many people who were considered enemies of the state, in the 
            Anhatomirim Island Fortress. Possibly to show loyalty to the marshal, 1893 saw the change of the state capital's name: from 
            Desterro to Florianópolis, that is to say, city of Floriano.
